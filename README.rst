precise garbage collection for C++

To deal with circular references, a garbage collector has to keep track of all
references between garbage collected objects. Typically, for statically typed
language, a list of offsets to all references to other garbage collected objects
is generated at compile time for each type. This is also possible in C++ to some
extent.

Despite C++ puts a strong emphasis on compile-time programming, C++ experts
prefer to do this at runtime. For example, last year, Herb Sutter `talked about
his gcpp`__ . It plays the same trick as `Smieciuch Garbage Collector`__, which
has been around for over a decade. They have to check if a pointer is located in
GC heap or not when constructor is called and record the address of the
pointer. This will make a moving garbage collector sick.

.. code:: c++

    struct gcptr {
       gcptr(...) {
         if (located_in_gc_heap(this)) {
           // this is a pointer from non-root
         } else {
           // this is a pointer from root
         }
       }
     }

Since pointer to member can be used as a template argument, and with stateful
metaprograming, especially `friend injection techique discovered by Filip
Ros√©en`__ , they can be stored in a compile-time list. Then we initialize the
static variable used by the garbage collector, by a call to a constexpr
function, which returns an array of offsets and its size.

Here is a simple example. :code:`gc.hpp` implements the same algorithm as
described in `Garbage Collection for Python`__ . As you can see, two Cycle
objects which references to each other, are destructed, after
:code:`::gc::collect()`.
